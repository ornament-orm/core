     *   ['offset' => $number]. To order the results (if the adapter supports
     *   that; Pdo does but maybe some API's don't) use ['order' => $bywhat].
     * It's okay for an adapter to support more extensive parameters or
     * additional options, but they'll likely be silently dropped by other
     * adapters in use.

     *  of course) of type __CLASS__, or null if nothing matched.
